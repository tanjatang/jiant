The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security , and symbolic of ideological superiority . The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites , unmanned space probes of the Moon , Venus , and Mars , and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon . The competition began on August 2 , 1955 , when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year , by declaring they would also launch a satellite \" in the near future \". The Soviet Union beat the US to this , with the October 4 , 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1 , and later beat the US to the first human in space , Yuri Gagarin , on April 12 , 1961 . The Space Race peaked with the July 20 , 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11 . The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions , and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations . A period of d\u00e9tente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co - operative Apollo \u2013 Soyuz Test Project , resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 42], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [42, 74], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [74, 95], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [95, 130], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [130, 177], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [177, 218], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [218, 241], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [241, 262], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [262, 303], "label": "0"}]}

At the beginning of the 20th century , efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell ' s paradox ( on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves ).

He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn , but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn ' s own ideas , adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted . Bronn translated \" favoured races \" as \" perfected races \", and added essays on issues including the origin of life , as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn ' s adherence to Naturphilosophie . In 1862 , Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin ' s suggested additions , but then died of a heart attack . Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus , who published an improved translation in 1867 . Darwin ' s attempts to find a translator in France fell through , and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin ' s ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics , as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed .

The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in El Salvador as they had in other lands like Guatemala or Mexico , but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador , they attempted to conquer it .

After fierce battles , the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by Pedro de Alvarado along with their Mexican Indian allies ( the Tlaxcalas ), sending them back to Guatemala . After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies , the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan . After further attacks , the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people . Eventually , the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women , resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people .

Until recently , in the absence of prior agreement on a clear and precise definition , the concept was thought to mean ( as a shorthand ) ' a division of sovereignty between two levels of government '. New research , however , argues that this cannot be correct , as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible . The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid - nineteenth century , over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession , showed this . One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters , but not both simultaneously . Therefore , it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as ' a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government '. What differentiates the concept from other multi - level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established . This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms , where before only one was known , based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole ( in one people ) or in the parts ( in many peoples ): the federal state ( or federation ) and the federal union of states ( or federal union ), respectively .

The key advantage of the four - rail system is that neither running rail carries any current . This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents , intended to be carried by the earthed ( grounded ) running rail , flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead . This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together . The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains . Some of these , particularly Victorian mains that predated London ' s underground railways , were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments . The four - rail system solves the problem . Although the supply has an artificially created earth point , this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels . Power - only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak , but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains . However , elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 28], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [28, 61], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [61, 79], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [79, 104], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [104, 135], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [135, 144], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [144, 173], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [173, 214], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [214, 251], "label": "0"}]}

Faced with the stripping of their powers , Wu Sangui , later joined by Geng Zhongming and by Shang Kexi ' s son Shang Zhixin , felt they had no choice but to revolt . The ensuing Revolt of the Three Feudatories lasted for eight years . Wu attempted , ultimately in vain , to fire the embers of south China Ming loyalty by restoring Ming customs , ordering that the resented queues be cut , and declaring himself emperor of a new dynasty . At the peak of the rebels ' fortunes , they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River , nearly establishing a divided China . Wu then hesitated to go further north , not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies , and Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals . By 1681 , the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China which took several decades to recover . Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army , who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by Kangxi , leading him to task Generals Sun Sike , Wang Jinbao , and Zhao Liangdong to lead Green Standard Soldiers to crush the rebels . The Qing thought that Han Chinese were superior at battling other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of Bannermen . Similarly , in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen , the Qing used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals such as Zhang Liangdong , Wang Jinbao , and Zhang Yong as the primary military forces .

Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured \" to make information available to the greatest number of people .\" As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century , public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies . More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text . Sir Isaac Newton ' s celebrated Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [29, 49], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [49, 77], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [77, 93], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [93, 117], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [117, 140], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [140, 183], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [183, 204], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [204, 242], "label": "1"}]}

Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle , the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo ' s small telescope .

A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels ( e . g ., anger , pride , fear , happiness ), physiological changes ( e . g ., increased perspiration , changes in pulse rate ), expressive facial and body movements ( e . g ., smiling , frowning , baring teeth ), and appraisals of situational cues . One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner ( 2007 : 2009 ). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions . When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold , they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self , other and situation are met or not met . People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals . Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology , psychology , evolutionary science , and neuroscience . Based on this analysis , he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive - anger , aversion - fear , satisfaction - happiness , and disappointment - sadness . These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences . These more elaborate emotions are called first - order elaborations in Turner ' s theory and they include sentiments such as pride , triumph , and awe . Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low - intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion - fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [20, 93], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [93, 112], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [112, 132], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [132, 173], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [173, 195], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [195, 219], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [219, 255], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [255, 284], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [284, 312], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 20], "span2": [312, 348], "label": "0"}]}

The Rus \u2019 burned towns , churches , and monasteries , butchering the people and amassing booty .

Following Nazi Germany ' s defeat in World War II in 1945 , war - torn East Prussia was divided at Joseph Stalin ' s insistence between the Soviet Union ( the Kaliningrad Oblast in the Russian SFSR and the constituent counties of the Klaip\u0117da Region in the Lithuanian SSR ) and the People ' s Republic of Poland ( the Warmian - Masurian Voivodeship ). The capital city K\u00f6nigsberg was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946 . The German population of the province was largely evacuated during the war or expelled shortly thereafter in the expulsion of Germans after World War II . An estimated 300 , 000 ( around one fifth of the population ) died either in war time bombings raids or in the battles to defend the province .

The key advantage of the four - rail system is that neither running rail carries any current . This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents , intended to be carried by the earthed ( grounded ) running rail , flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead . This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together . The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains . Some of these , particularly Victorian mains that predated London ' s underground railways , were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments . The four - rail system solves the problem . Although the supply has an artificially created earth point , this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels . Power - only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak , but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains . However , elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [11, 29], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [29, 62], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [62, 80], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [80, 105], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [105, 136], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [136, 145], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [145, 174], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [174, 215], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [215, 252], "label": "0"}]}

This worm - like form can be one of several varieties : eruciform ( caterpillar - like ), scarabaeiform ( grub - like ), campodeiform ( elongated , flattened and active ), elateriform ( wireworm - like ) or vermiform ( maggot - like ). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa , a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon . There are three types of pupae : obtect , exarate or coarctate . Obtect pupae are compact , with the legs and other appendages enclosed . Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended . Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin . : 151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage , and emerge as adults .

The back emf of the motor , plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes , must equal the voltage at the brushes . This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor . If the mechanical load increases , the motor slows down ; a lower back emf results , and more current is drawn from the supply . This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 37], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [37, 57], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [57, 69], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [69, 96], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [96, 109], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [109, 135], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [135, 148], "label": "0"}]}

Traditionally , any exposed copper was coated with solder by hot air solder levelling ( HASL ).

In addition , many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres ( 591 ft ) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene , and are still rising today .

Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont , Quebec , Ontario and Michigan . Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression , Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed , floodplain and cave deposits . Holocene marine deposits along low - latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non - glacial origin .

The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium ' s ability to fission ( break apart ) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn ' s laboratory in Berlin . Lise Meitner and her nephew , the physicist Otto Robert Frisch , published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process \" nuclear fission \". Soon after , Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction . Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 , and later work found that on average about 2 . 5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium - 235 . Further work found that the far more common uranium - 238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium , which , like uranium - 235 , is also fissile by thermal neutrons .

A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing . Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way , this form kills them . Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation , or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance , as in ambush predators . Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it , such as a jaguar or a human ; others may eat their ( usually much smaller ) prey whole , as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish , or a snake , duck or stork swallowing a frog . Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size ( domestic cats and dogs are prime examples ) may do either depending upon the circumstances ; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit . Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing , which the box jellyfish does , or disabling it , found in the behavior of the cone shell . In some cases , the venom , as in rattlesnakes and some spiders , contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating . In other cases , the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator . Baleen whales , for example , eat millions of microscopic plankton at once , the prey being broken down well after entering the whale . Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation , as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms . Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely .

By March 2011 , the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14 %. Whether the size of the Mac ' s market share and installed base is relevant , and to whom , is a hotly debated issue . Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac ' s relatively small market share to predict Apple ' s impending doom , particularly in the early and mid - 1990s when the company ' s future seemed bleakest . Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac ' s success . Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher - end personal computer , and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC . Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly , the Mac ' s increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry ' s expanding sales volume as a whole . Apple ' s small market share , then , gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago , when exactly the opposite is true . Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple ' s profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010 , dropping to 24 % from 46 % two years earlier . Others try to de - emphasize market share , citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries . Regardless of the Mac ' s market share , Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs ' return and the company ' s subsequent reorganization . Notably , a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14 % market share in the personal computer market in the US , including 66 % of all computers over $ 1 , 000 .

A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior . Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area . This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission . It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates . Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate . There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load , making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important . Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism , which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections . There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load . Thus , polygny may also be due to a lower male : female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases . Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [12, 29], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [29, 46], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [46, 84], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [84, 102], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [102, 115], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [115, 140], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [140, 167], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [167, 190], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [190, 216], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [216, 249], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [249, 270], "label": "1"}]}
